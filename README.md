### Little More About Me  

Hey there! ðŸ˜„ My name is Hope Kenga. I'm a 22-year-old  developer and blogger from Nairobi, Kenya who's a lover of life with a soft spot for family, nature, cats and cooking. I'm passionate about building interactive UI's that are clean and aesthetically pleasing. I build something new every week so pass by and pick a template on the frontend. I'm currently working with a really great team to build a great PWA to serve a great purpose.I love meeting new people and learning new things, so please feel free to say hello and share a story with me. I'm good at Team Building and collaboration and I'm currently working with a really great and innovative team to build <a href="marketxmn.com">Market X</a>
